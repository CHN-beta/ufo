This is a program to approximately unfold phonon spectra.

Currently, there is no documentation, and some not core features are in other branches
  and implemented in a temporary way, e.g., directly writing data in source file.

I will finish the documentation and merge these features into main branch ASAP.

The program is packaged in a standard way of cmake, so that you can build it just like other cmake projects:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

and view source files for input and output format.
